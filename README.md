# java-util
A utiility collection for Java that's not usually being used or not part of the Java libraries. This will be open-source and you're free to contribute.
## Usage
### For Local Testing
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a `main` Java class
3. Initialize the class you're going to use and make sure it's imported in the `main` class
4. Add a main method
5. Compile by running `javac main.java`
6. Run by executing `java main`
### For Your Project
1. Open your terminal/command prompt
2. Go to the `.java` directory to use as library
3. Execute the command `javac -d ./build *.java`
4. Configure your project and add the generated `.jar` file as "External Archive"

## Requirements
### MacOS
- JDK - if you prefer OpenJDK that's fine :)
- Path - so that when you run `javac` or `java` it knows which Java version to use

## Windows OS
- For windows, you might need extra steps to set your `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME`. You can Google these steps.
