# java-util
A utiility collection for Java that's not usually being used or not part of the Java libraries. This will be open-source and you're free to contribute.
## Usage
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a `main` Java class
3. Initialize the class you're going to use and make sure it's imported in the `main` class
4. Add a main method
5. Compile by running `javac main.java`
6. Run by executing `java main`

## Requirements
### MacOS
- JDK - if you prefer OpenJDK that's fine :)
- Path - so that when you run `javac` or `java` it knows which Java version to use

## Windows OS
- For windows, you might need extra steps to set your `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME`. You can Google these steps.
